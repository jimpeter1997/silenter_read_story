# 欲仙欲死的查
## 准备工作
```bash
# 链接数据库
mysql -u root -p
# 创建数据库
create database python_test charset=utf8;
# 使用数据库
use python_test;
# 显示当前在什么数据库
select database();
# 创建表
create table students(
    id int unsigned auto_increment primary key not null,
    name varchar(20) not null,
    age tinyint unsigned default 0,
    height decimal(5,2),
    gender enum('男','女','中性','保密') default '保密',
    cls_id int unsigned default 0,
    is_delete bit default 0
);
# 创建classes表
create table classes(
    id int unsigned auto_increment primary key not null,
    name varchar(30) not null
);
# 插入一些数据
insert into students values
    (0, '张三', 18, 180.00,2,1,0),
    (0, '李四', 19, 181.00,1,2,0),
    (0, '王五', 20, 182.00,2,1,0),
    (0, '赵六', 21, 179.00,3,2,0),
    (0, '令狐冲', 22, 178.00,4,1,0),
    (0, '韦小宝', 23, 177.00,1,1,0),
    (0, '郭靖', 24, 176.00,2,2,0),
    (0, '杨康', 25, 175.00,2,2,0),
    (0, '彭于宴', 26, 174.00,4,1,0),
    (0, '郭嘉', 27, 173.00,2,1,0),
    (0, '张飞', 28, 172.00,2,2,0),
    (0, '小乔', 29, 171.00,2,2,0),
    (0, '大乔', 30, null,2,1,0),
    (0, '杨贵妃', 21, 159.00,1,1,0),

    (0, '王昭君', 32, 157.00,3,1,0),
    (0, '貂蝉', 33, 156.00,2,2,0);

insert into classes values  (0, '三年一班'),
                            (0, '三年二班'),
                            (0, '三年三班');
# 随意查询一下
select * from students;
select * from classes;
select id, name from classes;
select name, age from students;
select name as 姓名, age as 年龄 from students;
# 给表起个名字
select s.name, s.age from students as s;
# 下面这行是错误的
-- select students.name, students.age from students as s; 此行错误
# 去重
select gender from students;
select distinct gender from students;
```

## 条件查询 select ... from 表名 where <query>
```bash
# 查询大于28岁的信息
select * from students where age > 28;
select * from students where age < 28;
select * from students where age >= 28;
select * from students where age <= 28;
select * from students where age != 28;
# 逻辑运算 and 、 or 、 not
select * from students where age >21 and age < 26;
select * from students where age <21 or age > 26;
select * from students where age > 25 and height >170;
select * from students where age > 25 or height >170;
select * from students where not age >21 and gender=2;
select * from students where not (age >21 and gender=2);
select * from students where (not age >21) and (not gender=2);
```

## 模糊查询 like、 rlike + 正则\ 效率 较低
```bash
# 以令开头
select name from students where name like '令%';
# 有令
select name from students where name like '%令%';
# 查询两个字的名字: 占位符 : _
select name from students where name like '__';
# 查询两个字以上名字的人
select name from students where name like '__%';

# 正则表达式
select name from students where name rlike '^张.*';
```

## 范围查询
```bash
select name, age from students where age in (21, 23, 30);
select name, age from students where age not in (21, 23, 30);
select name, age from students where age between 21 and 24;
select name, age from students where age not between 21 and 24;
# a = None 不指向任何内容  
# a = "" 指向空
select * from students where height is null;
select * from students where height is not null;
```

## 排序   order by
```bash
# 从小到大排序
select * from students where (age between 21 and 34) and gender = 2;
select * from students where (age between 21 and 34) and gender = 2 order by age;
select * from students where (age between 21 and 34) and gender = 2 order by age asc;
select * from students where (age between 21 and 34) and gender = 2 order by height desc;

select * from students where (age between 21 and 34) and gender = 2 order by age desc, id desc;
# 年龄从小到大，身高从大到小
select * from students order by age asc, height desc;

```
## 聚合函数
```bash
# count： 计算总数
select * from students where gender=1;
select count(*) from students where gender=1;
select count(*) as 男性总数 from students where gender=1;
# max： 最大值
select age from students;
select max(age) from students;
select max(age) as 女性最高身高 from students where gender=2;
# min： 最小值
select min(age) as 女性最低身高 from students where gender=2;
# sum： 总和
select sum(age) as 女性年龄总和 from students where gender=2;
# avg： 平均值
select avg(age) as 女性年龄平均值 from students where gender=2;
select sum(age)/count(*) as 女性年龄平均值 from students where gender=2;
# round：
select round(sum(age)/count(*),2) as `女性年龄平均值(保留二位小数)` from students where gender=2;
select round(sum(age)/count(*),3) as `女性年龄平均值(保留三位小数)` from students where gender=2;
select round(avg(age),2) as `女性年龄的平均值(保留两位小数)` from students where gender=2;
```
## 分组 goup by
```bash
# 按照性别分组
select gender from students group by gender;
# 按照性别分组，并统计个数
select gender, count(*) from students group by gender;
select gender, avg(*) from students group by gender;
select gender, max(*) from students group by gender;
select gender, min(*) from students group by gender;
select gender, group_concat(name) from students group by gender;
select gender, count(*), group_concat(name, '_', age, '_',id) from students where gender=2 group by gender;
# 查询平均年龄超过25岁的性别，以及姓名 having avg(age) > 25
select gender, group_concat(name),avg(age) from students group by gender having avg(age) > 25;
# 查询每种性别中人数多于2个的信息
select gender, group_concat(name),count(*) from students group by gender having count(*) > 5;

```
## 分页 limit (位于查询语句的最后面)

```bash
# 直接限制查询出来的个数
select * from students limit 2;
# limit start count
select * from students limit 0, 5;
select * from students limit 5, 5;
select * from students limit 10, 5;
select * from students limit 15, 5;
select * from students limit 20, 5;
select * from students limit 25, 5;
select * from students limit 30, 5;

```
## 链接查询  inner join 。。。 on
外键： 存储着另外一个表的主键，如果你存储的外键，在另外表中不存在，那么报错（也就是约束）
```bash
# 内链接 select ... from 表A inner join 表B on <query>
select * from students inner join classes;
select * from students inner join classes on students.cls_id = classes.id;
select a.name,a.age, a.height,a.gender,b.name from students as a inner join classes as b on a.cls_id = b.id;
select a.name as 姓名,a.age as 年龄, a.height as 身高,a.gender as 性别,b.name as 班级 from students as a inner join classes as b where a.cls_id = b.id;
select b.name, a.* from students as a inner join classes as b where a.cls_id = b.id;
select b.name, a.* from students as a inner join classes as b where a.cls_id = b.id order by b.name;
# 先按班级排序，再按students中的ID排序
select b.name, a.* from students as a inner join classes as b where a.cls_id = b.id order by b.name , a.id;
# 外链接： 左链接、右链接
# 左链接以左边的表格为基准，如果左边表存在，那边不管右边表中存在与否，都显示。
select * from students as a left join classes as b on a.cls_id=b.id;
# 查询没有对应班级的人
select * from students as a left join classes as b on a.cls_id=b.id having c.id is null;
# 不说右链接，把右链接转化成为左链接处理
```
## 自关联： 表a中列的信息是表a另外一行的主键（省份、行政级别）
```bash
create table areas(
    aid int primary key,
    atitle varchar(30),
    pid int
);
# 去网上拉一份全国省份的.sql文件
# 找到最高行政级别的省份
select * from areas where pid is null;
# 看一下北京的aid
select aid from areas where atitle='北京市';
select * from areas where pid=(select aid from areas where atitle='北京市');
select * from areas as province inner join areas as city on city.pid=province.aid having province.atitle='山东省';
select province.atitle, city.atitle from areas as province inner join areas as city on city.pid=province.aid having province.atitle='山东省';
```
## 子查询： 一个select，嵌套另外一个select,(时间久，尽量少用)
```mysql
select * from students where height=188;
select * from students where height=(select max(height) from students);
```
